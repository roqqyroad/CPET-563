With one camera there can be several points that map to one set of #coords. There's no way to know which point you ARE looking at.

If there is a second camera, you can see them at a different angle, and better tell where they are and match them to a set of #coords.

#ParallelStereoCameras means that they are 
T is the #Baseline, the distance between the two cameras.
The further they are, the more depth, but there is also some loss in some regards.
